# prework-study-guide


## Description

This project was created to further my understanding of web development.  After deploying HTML CSS & JavaScript this webpage was able to display information about the tools used in this process

## Installation

First we had to use HTML to set up the backbone of the webpage and then use css to style the font that was put on it and JavaScript was used to interact with the user via the console.  These steps were done in order to then put notes and display information about these tools in a pleasant way.

## Usage
each section contains note about topics related to how the website was developed.  You can see the console printing and using concepts and practices related to JavaScript.  You can do this by simply opening the console or "inspecting" a webpage.

## Credits

"N/A"

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
